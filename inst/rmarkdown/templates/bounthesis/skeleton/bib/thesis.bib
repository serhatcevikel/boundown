  abstract = {The ‘disposition effect’ is the tendency to sell assets that have gained value (‘winners’) and keep assets that have lost value (‘losers’). Disposition effects can be explained by the two features of prospect theory: the idea that people value gains and losses relative to a reference point (the initial purchase price of shares), and the tendency to seek risk when faced with possible losses, and avoid risk when a certain gain is possible. Our experiments were designed to see if subjects would exhibit disposition effects. Subjects bought and sold shares in six risky assets. Asset prices fluctuated in each period. Contrary to Bayesian optimization, subjects did tend to sell winners and keep losers. When the shares were automatically sold after each period, the disposition effect was greatly reduced.

  abstract = {Humans exhibit a number of suboptimal behaviours in the wake of a loss. For  example, gamblers often ‘chase’ their losses in an attempt to break even.  Similarly, investors tend to hold on to losing stocks too long in the hope that the  declining share price might make a recovery. However, the neural mechanisms  that instantiate such behaviour are poorly understood. I begin the introductory  chapter with a basic historical overview of fundamental economic concepts,  interleaving intersecting ideas from psychology and neuroscience. This leads to  a more in-depth exploration of the notion that loss-related behavioural biases  might provide insight into the neural mechanisms that underlie risky choice.  From this, I argue that rats represent a viable animal model of risky decision-  making for neuroeconomic research. The original research presented in  Chapters 2 – 5 pave the way toward advancing our current understanding of  loss-related biases in behaviour with rat models of risky decision-making. By  employing insight from psychology and economics, I developed two models of  rat behaviour that can be used to study the neural substrates of loss valuation. I  presented the experimental paradigms in Chapters 2 and 5, while  demonstrating novel loss-related correlations between the midbrain dopamine  system and observed loss behaviour in Chapters 3 and 4. The results  presented in Chapter 5 demonstrate that rats are capable of producing  behavioural patterns akin to loss aversion and the disposition effect. This work  has also highlighted a number of areas for future research. In Chapter 6, I  explore potential theoretical implications of the results discussed in previous  chapters. In summary, this thesis uses experimental risky decision-making  tasks in rats to advance our current knowledge of the ways in which concepts  such as loss aversion critically influence our internal representation of value.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study and describe several biases in investment decision-making through the review of research articles in the area of behavioral finance. It also includes some of the analytical and foundational work and how this has progressed over the years to make behavioral finance an established and specific area of study. The study includes behavioral patterns of individual investors, institutional investors and financial advisors. Design/methodology/approach The research papers are analyzed on the basis of searching the keywords related to behavioral finance on various published journals, conference proceedings, working papers and some other published books. These papers are collected over a period of year’s right from the time when the most introductory paper was published (1979) that contributed this area a basic foundation till the most recent papers (2016). These articles are segregated into biases wise, year-wise, country-wise and author wise. All research tools that have been used by authors related to primary and secondary data have also been included into our table. Findings A new era of understanding of human emotions, behavior and sentiments has been started which was earlier dominated by the study of financial markets. Moreover, this area is not only attracting the, attention of academicians but also of the various corporates, financial intermediaries and entrepreneurs thus adding to its importance. The study is more inclined toward the study of individual and institutional investors and financial advisors’ investors but the behavior of intermediaries through which some of them invest should be focused upon, narrowing down population into various variables, targeting the expanding economies to reap some unexplained theories. This study has identified 17 different types of biases and also summarized in the form of tables. Research limitations/implications The study is based on some of the most recent findings to have a quick overview of the latest work carried out in this area. So far very few extensive review papers have been published to highlight the research work in the area of behavioral finance. This study will be helpful for new researches in this field and to identify the areas where possible work can be done. Practical implications Practical implication of the research is that companies, policymakers and issuers of securities can watch out of investors’ interest before issuing securities into the market. Social implications Under the Social Implication, investors can recognize several behavioral biases, take sound investment decisions and can also minimize their risk. Originality/value The essence of this paper is the identification of 17 types of biases and the literature related to them. The study is based on both, the literature on investment decisions and the biases in investment decision-making. Such study is less prevalent in the developing country like India. This paper does not only focus on the basic principles of behavioral finance but also explain some emerging concepts and theories of behavioral finance. Thus, the paper generates interest in the readers to find the solutions to minimize the effect of biases in decision-making.},

  abstract = {This thesis explores the opportunities for economic research that arise from importing empirical methods from the field of machine learning. Chapter 1 applies inductive learning to cross-sectional asset pricing. Researchers have documented over three hundred variables that can explain differences in cross-sectional stock returns. But which ones contain independent information? Chapter 1 develops a framework, deep conditional portfolio sorts, that can be used to answer this question and that is based on ideas from the machine learning literature, tailored to an asset-pricing application. The method is applied to predicting future stock returns based on past stock returns at different horizons, and short-term returns (i.e. the past six months of returns) rather than medium- or long-term returns are recovered as the variables that convey almost all information about future returns.  Chapter 2 argues that machine learning techniques, although focusing on predictions, can be used to test theories. In most theory tests, researchers control for known theories. In contrast, chapter 2 develops a simple model that illustrates how machine learning can be used to conduct an inductive test that allows to control for some unknown theories, as long as they are covered in some way by the data. The method is applied to the theory that realization utility and nominal loss aversion lead to the disposition effect (the propensity to sell winners rather than losers). An inductive test finds that short-term price trends and other features of the price history are more important to predict selling decisions than returns relative to purchase price. Chapter 3 provides another perspective on the disposition effect in the more traditional spirit of behavioral finance. It assesses the implications of different theories for an investor's probability to sell a stock as a function of the stock's return and then tests those implications empirically. Three different approaches that have been used in the literature are shown to lead to the, at first sight, contradictory findings that the probability to sell a stock is either V-shaped or inverted V-shaped in the stock's return. Since these approaches compute different conditional probabilities, they can be reconciled, however, when the conditioning set is taken into account.},
